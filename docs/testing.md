# Testing  

## Methodology  
Testing was done throughout the process while developing the project by the use of Django debug pages. In addition all code has been validated with different online tools as presented below.

* ### Html Code Validator
    * All the HTML pages code ran through [html code validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) and there were no issues found.

* ### CSS Code Validator
    * All the CSS code ran through using [css code validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) and there were no issues found.

There was however an error, and some warnings issues regarding the use of css variables that it could not validate, this only happened when I validated the code by URI.
