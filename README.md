# User Experience (UX)

-   ### Site Aims  
  The overall goal of this project is to create a restaurant webpage that is visually nice and easy to navigate to the user. Visitors should be able to find general information about the restaurant in the home page, as well as finding the menu offerings. In addition, visitors should be able to make a reservation for a table directly on the webpage. It will also provide a booking management admin panel for the restaurant owner.

## Agile Methodology

The principles of agile methodology were utilized during the project. By assigning user stories to issues and taking advantage of the GitHub Kanban board functionality, the necessary goals and priorities throughout the project could be well defined. In addition, labels were used to further define the priority of eacn user story in the Kanban board.
